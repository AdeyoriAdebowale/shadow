### Getting Started
*This was tested using discord.js v11*
1. Install packages
```
npm install
```
2. Input your token in config.json
```
{
	"token": "token-here"
}
```
3. Run scrape.js
```
node .
```

### Disclaimer
⚠️Warning⚠️

You can get banned for using self-bots, i don't give a shit if ur banned. If you want to call the await function before joining a server because it's going too fast, go ahead.

also code is 100% not messy, written by top tier egods. the end :)
